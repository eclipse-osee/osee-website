   <h1>Work Flow Definition Artifact</h1>
		<h2>Purpose</h2>
		The Work Flow Definition artifact specifies the workflow that a team moves through to complete
		an Action.  This artifact specifies the states, their transitions and the start state of the
		workflow.  Creation/Editing of this artifact can either be done through the Artifact Editor
		or using the Workflow Configuration Editor (OSEE 0.6.0 Release and beyond). 
		
		<h2>How to do it - <a href="WorkflowConfigurationEditor.html">Configuration Editor</a></h2>
      
		<h2>How to do it - Artifact Editor</h2>
		On the Common branch in the Artifact Editor, Expand "Action Tracking System" and right-click
		on "Work Flows", select New Child -> Work Flow Definition.  Enter a unique namespace name
		for this workflow (eg: org.<company>.code).  In the Artifact Editor, add and set the attributes
		and relations as below.
		<br><br>
      <li>Attributes</li>
      <ul>
         <li>Name:[unique namespace, usually the same as the Work Id specified below]</li>
         <li>osee.wi.Work Id:[unique workflow namespace] - this will preceed each state name
         specified in the workflow.</li>
         <li>osee.wi.Parent Work Id:[Work Id of Parent Work Flow Definition] - this will allow
         this workflow to inherit it's transitions and start state from another workflow.  This
         can not be used with other attributes below</li>
         <li>osee.wi.Start Page:[namespace.state name] - this specifies the name of the
         initial state in the workflow</li>
         <li>osee.wi.Transition:[[from state name];[transition type];[to state name]] - specifies
         the transition from state to state where</li>
            <ul>
               <li>[from state name]/[to state name]- unique Work Page Definition Work Id comprised of [namespace].[State Name]</li>
               <li>[transition type] - one of the following:</li>
                  <ul>
                     <li>ToPageAsDefault - Transition is "Default Transition" state</li>
                     <li>ToPage - Transition is optional transition to state</li>
                     <li>ToPageAsReturn - Optional transition to a previously visited state</li>
                  </ul>
            </ul>
         <li>osee.wi.Description:Optional attribute to add description of workflow</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Relations</li>
      <ul>
         <li>Work Item.Parent: Relate to any Team Definition configured to use this workflow.</li>
      </ul>

   <h1>Configure Actionable Items (AI)</h1>
		<h2>Purpose</h2>
		Actionable Items provide the end user with a selection of things impacted by the Action.  They
		are related to the <a href="TeamDefinition.html">Team</a> that is responsible for performing the
		work.
		<h2>How to do it</h2>
   <ul>
         <li>AIs should not be deleted.  Instead, use the ats.Active attribute to deactivate the AI.
         If an AI must be deleted, search for all "ats.Actionable Item" attributes that have the value of the AI's guid.
         These must be changed to another AI before deletion.</li>
         <li>Actionable Item tree can be created to the level at which actions are to be written.  Usually a component decomposition.  In the case of UIs, create one for each view or window.</li>
         <li>Attributes</li>
         <ul>
            <li>Name:[uniquely recognizable team name]</li>
            <li>ats.Active:[yes]</li>
         </ul>
         <li>Relations</li>
         <ul>
            <li>DefaultHeirarchy: Relate to parent team or top level "Actionable Items" artifact"</li>
            <li>TeamActionableItem: Relate to team responsible for performing tasks.  Team can be related to parent and all children will have team by default.
         </ul>
   </ul>

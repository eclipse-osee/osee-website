   <h1>Work Rule Definition Artifact</h1>
		<h2>Purpose</h2>
		The Work Rule Definition artifact specifies a single rule that can be applied to workflow configurations
		or to <a href="TeamDefinition.html">Team Definition</a> artifacts.  These rules are normally backed by
		java code that performs certain tasks like automatically creating new reviews, assigning 
		workflows to specific users or specifying states as allowing create/commit of branches.
		
		<h2>How to do it - Artifact Editor</h2>
		On the Common branch in the Artifact Editor, Expand "Action Tracking System" expand
		"Work Rule" and double-click any existing Work Rule.  Edit the following attributes and relations 
		accordingly.
		<br><br>
      <li>Attributes</li>

         <li>Name:[unique name matching Work Id below]</li>
         <li>osee.wi.Work Id:[unique workflow namespace].[Work Page Name] as below.</li>
         <li>osee.wi.Work Description:Simple description explaining what rule does.</li>
         <li>osee.wi.Work Data:Key/Value pares of information used by rule.</li>
      </ul>

<h1><a id="section1">1. </a>ATS Overview</h1>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
To give a brief overview of the Action Tracking System (ATS) including
terms and architecture.
<h2>Powerpoint Overview</h2>
<a href="./reference/overview/OSEE%20ATS%20Overview.pdf">Select to View Overview</a>
<br><br>
<h2>Terms</h2>
<b><a href="./reference/configure/ActionableItems.html">Actionable Item (AI)</a></b>
- Item that can be impacted by an Action. AIs are what the user has to
select from when creating an Action. Examples: Flight Box, Lab
Computer, Code Subsystem.<br><br>
<b><a href="./reference/configure/TeamDefinition.html">Team Workflow Definition</a></b>
- Teams are created to perform that work associated with the Action.
They are related to the AIs that they are responsible for and are
configured with Leads and Members to route the Actions and perform the
work. A workflow is configured that the team will follow to perform the
work.<br><br>
<b><a href="./reference/configure/WorkflowConfiguration.html">Workflow Configuration</a></b> - State machine that shows the path the Team will follow to perform the work associated with the Action.<br><br>
<b>Action</b> - Top level grouping object. An Action is written against
any number of AIs. The Team Workflows are then created for each team
configured to perform work for an AI.<br><br>
<b>Team Workflow</b> - Instantiation of a Workflow Diagram needed to
perform the work. Each team independently moves through their workflow
state machine however ATS can be configured such that certain gates
must be met from other Teams or outside events before a workflow can
continue.<br><br>
<b>Task</b> - Within states of a Team Workflow, smaller-light-weight
Tasks can be created to further separate the work that needs to be
completed for that state. Normally, the state can not continue until
the Task is completed.<br><br>
<b>Versions</b> - ATS has built in project/release planning.  Versions are created to group Team Workflows (Actions) into Builds and Releases.<br><br>

		<h1><a id="section7.1">7.1. </a>Peer To Peer Review Workflow</h1>
		<h2>Purpose</h2>
		The Peer To Peer Review is a lightweight review type that enables interactive one-on-one reviews where two people sit
		at a single computer and review, disposition and resolve the issues as they are found.  This review type does not 
		require (but does allow) defects to be logged.  This review type can be created as a stand-alone review or attached to
		any workflow.  When attached to a workflow, it is related to a state and can be set as a "blocking" review that will
		keep the workflow from continuing until the review is completed.

<h1><a id="section8.1">8.1. </a>Configure ATS for Change Tracking</h1>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
ATS is used to track any type of change throughout the lifecycle of a
project. Below are the steps to configure ATS for tracking something
new.
<h2>How to do it</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Review <a href="./reference/overview/ats_overview.html">ATS
	Overview</a> to understand ATS Concepts, Terms and Architecture. Pay
	special attention to ATS Terms</li>
	<li>Determine what Actionable Items (AIs) need to be available to
	the user to select from. This can be anything from a single AI for
	tracking something like a tool or even an activity that needs to be
	done to a hierarchical decomposition of an entire software product or
	engineering program.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Considerations:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Item should be in the context of what the user would
			recognize. eg: OSEE ATS World View versus something unknown to the
			user such as AtsWorldView.java.</li>
			<li>Decompose AI into children AI when it is desired to
			sort/filter/report by that decomposition.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Actionable Item attributes to be configured:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Name: Unique name that the user would identify with.</li>
			<li>Active: yes (converted to "no" when AI is no longer
			actionable)</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Actionable Item relations to be configured:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>TeamActionableItem: relate to Team Definition that is
			responsible for performing the tasks associated with this AI. NOTE:
			If this relation is not set, ATS will walk up the Default Hierarchy
			to find the first AI with this relation.</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<li>Determine the teams that are going to perform the tasks that
	are associated with the AIs selected by the user.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Considerations:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Use separate teams if certain changes are to be managed by
			different leads.</li>
			<li>Use separate teams if one team's completion and releasing is
			independent of another's.</li>
			<li>Use separate teams if team members are separate.</li>
			<li>Use separate teams if different workflows are required for
			one set of AIs than another.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Team attributes to be configured:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Name: Unique team name that is distinguishable from other
			teams in a list.</li>
			<li>Description: Full description of the team and it's scope.</li>
			<li>Active: yes (converted to "no" when AI is no longer
			actionable)</li>
			<li>Team Uses Versions: yes if team workflows are going to use
			the build management and release capabilities of ATS.</li>
			<li>Full Nam: Extended name for the team. Expansion of acronym
			if applicable</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Team relations to be configured:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>TeamActionableItem: relation to all AIs that this team is
			responsible for.</li>
			<li>Work Item.Child: WorkFlowDefinition artifact
			configures the state machine that
			this team works under. NOTE: If this relation is not set, ATS will
			walk up the Default Hierarchy to find the first AI with this
			relation.</li>
			<li>TeamLead: User(s) that are leading this team. These users
			will be assigned to the Endorse state of the Team Workflow upon
			creation of an Action by a user. Providing multiple leads reduces
			bottlenecks. First lead to handle the Team Workflow wins.</li>
			<li>TeamMember: User(s) that are members of the team. These
			users will be shown first as preferred assignees and have the ability
			to privileged edit a Team Workflow for the team they belong to.</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<li>Choose existing WorkFlowDefinition or create new WorkFlowDefinition
	 to be used by the team and relate it to Team Definition (as
	above).  This can be done through File-&gt;New-&gt;Workflow Configuration.  Enter a namespace
	and a default workflow will be created and can be edited.</li>
	<li>Create version artifacts necessary (if using versions) and
	relate them to Team Definition (as above)</li>
	<ul>
		<li>If branching of artifacts is going to be used (see below), configure versions
		with their appropriate parent branch id.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Determine if Branching within one of the states in the workflow is desired/required
	and configure as appropriate.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Considerations:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Branching is necessary if objects to change are stored in OSEE as artifacts.
			If so, OSEE ATS can create a working branch off the parent branch, allow user
			to modify artifacts and then commit these changes when complete, reviewed and
			authorized (as necessary).  If objects are stored outside OSEE (eg. code files
			checked into SVN), this option is not necessary.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Configure ATS workflow for branching:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Create AtsStateItem extension specifying which state the branching will occur.
			This is normally in the Implement state of a workflow.</li>
			<li>Create root branch and import documents that will be managed through define
			and tracked through ATS.</li>
			<li>Set all Version artifacts "Parent Branch Id" attribute to the branch id
			of the root branch (or child branches, if using multi-branching)</li>
			<li>If only a single branch is to be used OR versioning is NOT configured to be
			used, the "Parent Branch Id" should be s</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>

</ul>

   <h1><a id="section8.4">8.4. </a>Workflow Configuration</h1>
		<h2>Purpose</h2>
		To create a new workflow configuration that ATS uses to move an Action through it's specific workflow.
		<h2>Ats Workflow Configuration artifacts.</h2>
		ATS uses four main artifacts to configure a workflow for use by a Team.
      <ul>
         <li><a href="./reference/configure/WorkFlowDefinition.html">Work Flow Definition</a><a> specifies
         the states, their transitions and the state that represents the beginning of the 
         workflow.</a></li>
<a>         </a><li><a href="./reference/configure/WorkPageDefinition.html">Work Page Definition</a><a> defines
         the a single state of the Work Flow Definition.</a></li>
<a>         </a><li><a href="./reference/configure/WorkWidgetDefinition.html">Work Widget Definition</a><a> defines
         a single widget and its corresponding attribute that the value will be stored in.  It 
         also provides some layout capabilities for that widget.</a></li>
<a>         </a><li><a href="./reference/configure/WorkRuleDefinition.html">Work Rule Definition</a><a> defines
         certain rules that can be applied to Work Pages and Team Definitions.</a></li>
<a>      </a></ul>
<a>		</a><h2><a>How to do it</a></h2>
<a>      </a><ul>
<a>         </a><li><a>Workflows can be created using the </a><a href="./reference/configure/WorkflowConfigurationEditor.html">
         ATS Workflow Configuration Editor</a><a> (0.6.0 release).  States and their transitions can 
         be edited through this interface.  Other modifications will need to be edited through 
         </a><a href="./reference/configure/create_workflowdefinition_artifact.html">Work Flow Definition</a><a> attributes
         and relations.</a></li>
<a>         </a><li><a>Work Pages, Widgets and Rules are currently edited through the
         attributes and relations using the default Artifact Editor.  See links above to
         set the proper values.</a></li>
<a>         </a><li><a>Configurations can also be created through the java.  An example of this can
         be seen by looking at the org.eclipse.osee.ats.config.demo plugin. This plugin, and the
         DemoDatabaseConfig.java class, shows how to programatically generate work flows, pages,
         rules and widgets to configure ATS.  This configuration will be generated during a database
         initialization.</a></li>

		<h2>Purpose</h2>
		Give a graphical method to creating / updating ATS Workflow Configurations.  This editor
		also gives easy access, through double-click" to edit the "Work Page Definition" artifact
		that represent the selected state.
		<h2>How to do it</h2>
		<ul>
		   <li>Open editor for a specific workflow:</li>
         <ul>
            <li>Existing Work Flow Definition Artifact: From Common branch in Artifact Explorer, expand Action Tracking System -&gt; Work Flows
            and double-click the workflow you wish to edit.</li>
            <li>From ATS Workflow Editor: Select workflow icon at top right and associated workflow
            will be opened.</li>
            <li>New Workflow Configuration: File -&gt; New -&gt; Other -&gt; OSEE ATS -&gt; Workflow Configuration;
             Enter unique namespace for this workflow configuration. (eg: org.<company>.code).  This 
             creates a simple workflow to use as a starting place.</company></li>
         </ul>
         
		   <li>Create states:</li>
         <ul>
            <li>Add necessary states to diagram to represent workflow.  Note: Only one state
            is the entry point and the workflow must end at the "Completed" state.  The "Cancelled"
            state is optional, but should be used in most cases.</li>
         </ul>
         
		   <li>Editing Rules, Widgets and other State attributes:  Double-click on any state to open
		   the Artifact in the Artifact Editor.</li>

 		   <li>Create transitions:</li>
         <ul>
	         <li>For each state, a single "Default Transition" must be specified.  This will
	         be the default state specified as the "next" state in the workflow.  Optional transitions
	         to other states can be specified by the "Transition" arrow.  The user will have the 
	         option of selecting one of these states instead.</li>
	         <li>The "Return Transition" can be specified for valid jumps "back" to previous states.
	         (eg: The user may need to transition back to the "Analyze" state from the "Authorize"
	         state if authorization failed and more analysis is needed.</li>
         </ul>
         <li>Select a single state and set it's "Start Page" property to "Yes" for the state
         specified to start the workflow.  Only one state can be the start state.</li>
 		   <li>Save and test the new workflow configuration:</li>
            <ul>
               <li>Select Save to persist the changes.  Validation will be automatically run (see below)</li>
               <li><a href="./reference/configure/TeamDefinition.html">Configure the Team Definition</a> to use the new workflow</li>
               <li>Create a new Action and test the created workflow</li>
            </ul>
         <li>   
      </li></ul>
      <h2>Workflow Configuration - Validation</h2>
		Validation of a workflow is provided by selecting the check icon and selecting a state,
		transition or the entire workflow (selecting the white background).  This will popup
		whatever error occurs or a "Validation Success" if all is ok.<br><br>
		Note: This same validation will occur during save and will fail if all problems are not resolved.

   <h1><a id="section8.4.2">8.4.2. </a>Work Flow Definition Artifact</h1>
		<h2>Purpose</h2>
		The Work Flow Definition artifact specifies the workflow that a team moves through to complete
		an Action.  This artifact specifies the states, their transitions and the start state of the
		workflow.  Creation/Editing of this artifact can either be done through the Artifact Editor
		or using the Workflow Configuration Editor (OSEE 0.6.0 Release and beyond). 
		
		<h2>How to do it - <a href="./reference/configure/WorkflowConfigurationEditor.html">Configuration Editor</a></h2>
      
		<h2>How to do it - Artifact Editor</h2>
		On the Common branch in the Artifact Editor, Expand "Action Tracking System" and right-click
		on "Work Flows", select New Child -&gt; Work Flow Definition.  Enter a unique namespace name
		for this workflow (eg: org.<company>.code).  In the Artifact Editor, add and set the attributes
		and relations as below.
		<br><br>
      <li>Attributes</li>
      <ul>
         <li>Name:[unique namespace, usually the same as the Work Id specified below]</li>
         <li>osee.wi.Work Id:[unique workflow namespace] - this will preceed each state name
         specified in the workflow.</li>
         <li>osee.wi.Parent Work Id:[Work Id of Parent Work Flow Definition] - this will allow
         this workflow to inherit it's transitions and start state from another workflow.  This

   <h1><a id="section8.4.3">8.4.3. </a>Work Page Definition Artifact</h1>
		<h2>Purpose</h2>
		The Work Page Definition artifact configures a single state of the <a href="./reference/configure/WorkFlowDefinition.html%3EWorkflow%20Definition%3C/a%3E%20for%20a%20%3Ca%20href=" workflowconfiguration.html="">Workflow Configuration</a>. 
		
		<h2>How to do it - <a href="./reference/configure/WorkflowConfigurationEditor.html">ATS Workflow Configuration Editor</a></h2>
		The ATS Workflow Configuration Editor will allow the editing of the three main fields of a
		Work Page Definition Artifact.  The remaining fields, and the relations to <a href="./reference/configure/WorkRuleDefinition.html">
		Work Rules</a> and <a href="./reference/configure/WorkWidgetDefinition.html">Work Widgets</a> must be done through the
		Artifact Editor.
      
		<h2>How to do it - Artifact Editor</h2>
		Work Page Definitions are either stored as children of their Work Flow Definition artifact or 
		under the "Work Pages" folder.
		<br>
		On the Common branch in the Artifact Editor, Expand "Action Tracking System" and right-click
		on "Work Page", select New Child -&gt; Work Page Definition, or double-click an existing Work Page
		Definition artifact.  Edit the following attributes and relations accordingly.
		<br><br>
      <li>Attributes</li>
      <ul>
         <li>Name:[unique name matching Work Id below]</li>
         <li>osee.wi.Work Id:[unique workflow namespace].[Work Page Name] as below.</li>
         <li>osee.wi.Parent Work Id:[Work Id of Parent Work Page Definition] - this will allow
         this workflow to inherit it's widgets and rules from another workflow.  This
         can not be used with other attributes below</li>
         <li>osee.wi.Work Page Name:State Name that the user will see.  This can not have any 
         special characters including . in the name.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Relations</li>
      <ul>
         <li>Work Item.Child: Relate to any Rules or Widgets that this state is made of.</li>
      </ul>

		<br>
		The default branch will have a <img src="ATS_files/black_check.gif"> at the top right of the normal branch icon.<br>
		<br>
		Most views and editors that are working with artifacts will show the branch in the status bar next to the branch icon.
		<h2>How to set it</h2>
		The default branch is set from the Branch Manager view. Use sorting or <a href="http://127.0.0.1:4441/help/topic/org.eclipse.osee.framework.ui.skynet/reference/branch_filtering.html">filtering</a> in the table to find the

		<h2>Branch Change Report</h2>
		<p>A Change Report can be performed for a branch two ways. The first way is by selecting right-clicking a branch 
		from the Branch Manager then choosing the "Show Change Report" menu item. The second way is to select
		"Show Change Report" from the Aspect view of an ATS Action that is still in work; this will do a Change
		Report for the working branch of the Aspect.</p>
		<p>This type of Change Report will display all of the artifacts on the branch that have had an attribute
		or relation link modified. It will also do conflict detection on these artifacts against the parent branch.
		All changes done on the current artifact will appear with a grey right arrow<img src="ATS_files/out_change_002.gif">, while all changes from the
		parent branch will be shown with a blue left arrow<img src="ATS_files/inc_change.gif">. Attributes and relation links with multiple changes will
		provide a summarized node that shows the final effect of the changes and can be expanded to view all of the
		minor changes that were made. If an attribute or relation link was modified on both
		branches then the summary will show a red conflict mark<img src="ATS_files/con_change.gif"> to signify that a commit will cause an override
		to occur.

	<h1><a id="section9.3.3">9.3.3. </a>Attribute Tagging for Quick Search</h1>

	<p>When an artifact is saved, each attribute contained in the artifact is analyzed to produce a list of 
	tags that are then associated with the artifact. Quick search is a form of <i>keyword</i> based searching 
	which uses tags to perform contextual artifact searches.</p>
	
	<p>For an attribute to be tagged by the system, it must meet the following criteria:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>The attribute's type must specify an <b>Attribute Tagger</b> to be used by the tagging system.</li>
		<li>The attribute must contain valid data.</li>
		<li>The attribute revision must be saved in the database before sending to tagging system.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>To produce tags, modified attributes are sent to the OSEE application server where the tagging system
	processes each attribute using an <b>Attribute Tagger</b> specified by the attribute's type. The <b>Attribute Tagger</b>
	knows how to interpret the attribute's data and how to extract words from the content. At this point, a word is defined
	as a sequential set of alphanumeric characters delimited by one or more spaces. As words are parsed, they are sent
	to the tagging system's word encoder where the following processing takes place:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>The characters in the original word are converted to lower case.</li>
		<li>The lower cased version of the word is encoded and stored in the tagging system.</li>
		<li>The lower cased version of the word is split using punctuation characters such as (<b><code>' '</code>, 
      <code>!</code>, <code>"</code>, <code>#</code>, <code>$</code>, 
      <code>%</code>, <code>(</code>, <code>)</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>+</code>, 
      <code>,</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>.</code>, <code>/</code>, <code>:</code>, 
      <code>;</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>?</code>, <code>@</code>, 
      <code>[</code>, <code>\</code>, <code>]</code>, <code>^</code>, <code>{</code>, 
      <code>|</code>, <code>}</code>, <code>~</code>, <code>_</code></b>) as delimiters.</li>
		<li>Possessive words <i>(ending in 's)</i> are converted into regular form.</li>
		<li>Each word is converted from plural to singular form.</li>
		<li>Each word is encoded and stored in the tag system.</li>		
	</ol>
	
	<p> When encoding words into tags, the tag encoder uses an algorithm which transforms the word's characters
	into a bit-packed tag that will fit in a 64-bit integer. The tag will represent up to 12 characters 
	(all that can fit into 64-bits). Longer words will be turned into consecutive tags.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Merge Manager is in place to find conflicts and help users resolve these 
conflicts.&nbsp; A conflict exists if the value of an attribute/artifact has 
changed on both the Destination and Source Branches.&nbsp; For reference the 
Source Branch is the users working branch.&nbsp; It is the branch that the user 
has been making changes to and would like to then add back into the Destination 
Branch or Baseline Branch.&nbsp; Both branches are identified by name in the 
header of the Merge Manager.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Depending upon the conflict found, the user may have several choices for 
resolution.&nbsp; These include </p>
<ul>
	<li>Accept the value on the Source Branch and overwrite the value on the 
	Destination Branch</li>
	<li>Accept the value on the Destination Branch and do not add any of the 
	Source Branch changes, (These will still show up as merged on
	<a href="http://127.0.0.1:4441/help/topic/org.eclipse.osee.framework.ui.skynet/reference/change_table.html">Change Reports</a>)</li>
	<li>Create a solution that is a combination of the two changes </li>
	<li>Revert the changes on the Source Branch&nbsp; (This is the only 
	available solution when the Artifact/Attribute was deleted on the 
	Destination Branch, will show up as no change on the
	<a href="http://127.0.0.1:4441/help/topic/org.eclipse.osee.framework.ui.skynet/reference/change_table.html">Change Report</a>)</li>
	<li>Do nothing (only possible for informational conflicts)</li>
</ul>
<p>Committing of Branches is blocked until all conflicts are resolved.</p>
<h2>The GUI</h2>
<p>The GUI is organized to provide the user with an ability to quickly identify 
conflicts.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>The Heading</b> - The Heading contains text to help identify what is 
	being merged. It identifies the Source Branch, and the Destination Branch.&nbsp; 
	It also provides the user with information about how many conflicts there 
	are and if they have been resolved.&nbsp; The Heading also contains easy 
	launch icons for additional tools in connection with the Merge Manager.</li>
	<li><b>The Conflict Resolution Column</b> - This column provides the user 
	information about the state of the conflict.&nbsp; A blank entry in the 
	column means that the conflict is new and has not had any actions performed 
	on it. A
	<img src="ATS_files/chkbox_disabled.gif" width="16" border="0" height="16"> 
	indicates that conflict is in the modified state.&nbsp; This means the user 
	has begun merging the conflict but has not marked it as resolved.&nbsp; The 
	user may transition it into the resolved state by left clicking on the
	<img src="ATS_files/chkbox_disabled.gif" width="16" border="0" height="16"> 
	icon. The
	<img src="ATS_files/accept.gif" width="16" border="0" height="16"> 
	icon indicates the user has marked the conflict as resolved.&nbsp; This 
	means they have selected a value for it and have verified the value going in 
	is what they want.&nbsp; No additional changes are allowed on a conflict 
	once it is in the resolved state.&nbsp; It can be placed back into the 
	modified state by left clicking on the
	<img src="ATS_files/accept.gif" width="16" border="0" height="16"> 
	icon. The
	<img src="ATS_files/chkbox_enabled_conflicted.gif" width="16" border="0" height="16"> 
	means that a conflict was in the resolved state but a new change has 
	occurred on either the Source or Destination Branch.&nbsp; It serves to 
	notify the user that the conflict was not in the finalized state when they 
	resolved the conflict.&nbsp; The user can return to resolved state by left 
	clicking on the&nbsp;
	<img src="ATS_files/chkbox_enabled_conflicted.gif" width="16" border="0" height="16"> 
	icon.&nbsp; The
	<img src="ATS_files/red_light.gif" width="16" border="0" height="16"> 
	icon indicates that an Artifact or Attribute must be reverted on the Source 
	Branch.&nbsp; This indicates that the Artifact/Attribute was deleted on the 
	Destination Branch and can not have a change committed onto it.&nbsp; The 
	user must abandon any change to that artifact attribute by using the revert 
	command.&nbsp; Once the Artifact/Attribute has been reverted the Merge 
	Manager will be refreshed and the conflict will be removed. The
	<img src="ATS_files/issue.gif" width="16" border="0" height="16">icon 
	indicates an informational conflict.&nbsp; The user does not have to take 
	any action to resolve these conflicts.&nbsp; It just provides the 
	information that the Source Branch deleted the Artifact/Attribute but the 
	Destination Branch has been modified.&nbsp; The user is free to act as 
	desired based on the provided information.</li>
	<li><b>The Artifact Name Column</b> - This column tells which artifact the 
	conflict occurred on.&nbsp; If the name is different between the Source and 
	Destination Branches, (this will show up as a conflict) it will at first 
	showing use the Source Branch value and then use whatever the name is 
	resolved to be after that has occurred.</li>
	<li><b>The Artifact Type Column</b> - Simply lists what type of Artifact is 
	conflicted</li>
	<li><b>The Conflicting Item Column</b> - In the case of an attribute 
	conflict it states what attribute type is conflicting.&nbsp; In the case of 
	an artifact conflict it will always say "Artifact State"</li>
	<li><b>The Source Value Column</b> - When possible this column tells what 
	value the Source Branch has for the conflict.&nbsp; It will always have a
	<img src="ATS_files/green_s.gif" width="16" border="0" height="16"> 
	icon. If the conflicting item is Word Formatted Content the words "Stream 
	data" will be shown.&nbsp; For artifact conflicts it will either show 
	"Modified" or "Deleted".&nbsp; Left clicking on the
	<img src="ATS_files/green_s.gif" width="16" border="0" height="16"> 
	icon will populate the Merge Branch with value found on the Source Branch.</li>
	<li><b>The Destination Value Column</b> - When possible this column tells 
	what value the Destination Branch has for the conflict.&nbsp; It will always 
	have a
	<img src="ATS_files/blue_d.gif" width="16" border="0" height="16"> 
	icon. If the conflicting item is Word Formatted Content the words "Stream 
	data" will be shown.&nbsp; For artifact conflicts it will either show 
	"Modified" or "Deleted".&nbsp; Left clicking on the
	<img src="ATS_files/blue_d.gif" width="16" border="0" height="16"> 
	icon will populate the Merge Branch with value found on the Destination 
	Branch.</li>
	<li><b>The Merge Value Column</b> - The Merged Value column serves to show 
	the user the value that has been selected for use when the Branch is 
	committed.&nbsp; The Merge value is actually kept on a new "Merge Branch" 
	and so any changes made to it will not affect the value seen on the Source 
	or Destination Branches.&nbsp; When the Merge Value column is blank with no 
	icon, the conflict is informational and no actions are provided.&nbsp; When 
	the Merge Value column contains a&nbsp;
	<img src="ATS_files/conflict.gif" width="16" border="0" height="16">icon 
	the value has not been set.&nbsp; This is the icon that should be shown for all 
	conflicts (Except informational conflicts, or same value conflicts) the 
	first time the user brings up the merge manager.&nbsp; The
	<img src="ATS_files/green_s.gif" width="16" border="0" height="16"> 
	icon indicates that the Source Value was selected as the final value.&nbsp; 
	The actual Source Value text will also be shown in this column if possible. 
	The
	<img src="ATS_files/blue_d.gif" width="16" border="0" height="16"> 
	icon indicates that the Destination Value was selected as the final value.&nbsp; 
	The Destination Value text will also be shown in this column if possible. 
	The
	<img src="ATS_files/yellow_m.gif" width="16" border="0" height="16"> 
	icon will be shown when a new value has been selected for the final value.&nbsp; 
	This indicates that the user has modified the final value so that it is no 
	longer a copy of the Source or Destination, but some variation thereof.&nbsp; 
	A
	<img src="ATS_files/accept.gif" width="16" border="0" height="16"> 
	icon indicates that although both the Source Branch Value and Destination 
	Branch Value have changed they were both changed to the same value and so 
	there is not really a conflict. Left clicking on the icon in the Merge Value 
	column will bring up the Merge Wizard or in the case of un-resolvable 
	conflicts a dialog offering the ability to revert the conflicting item.</li>
	<li><b><a name="The_Right_Click_Menu">The Right Click Menu</a></b> - Right clicking on any row will display a 
	menu with options for dealing with conflicts.&nbsp; 
<ul>
	<li>"Set Source as Default Branch" - This selection is a quick way to set 
	the Source Branch as the default branch.&nbsp; If the Source Branch is 
	already set as the Default Branch, the menu item will be grayed out and 
	there will be a check mark next to the option.</li>
	<li>"Set Destination as Default Branch" - This selection is a quick way to 
	set the Destination Branch as the default branch.&nbsp; If the Destination 
	Branch is already set as the Default Branch, the menu item will be grayed 
	out and there will be a check mark next to the option.</li>
	<li>"Edit Merge Artifact" - This option is only enabled for Word Formatted 
	Content conflicts and will bring up the Merge Artifact in Word.&nbsp; The 
	Merge Artifact is a separate version of the artifact that will preserve the 
	details of the Merge, and will be reviewable in the Merge Manager after an 
	artifact is committed.&nbsp; IMPORTANT: If the user makes the changes to 
	their Source Branch instead of on the Merge Artifact the Merge Manager will 
	incorrectly represent the merge in future reviews.</li>
	<li>"Generate Three Way Merge" - Will generate a <a href="http://127.0.0.1:4441/help/topic/org.eclipse.osee.framework.ui.skynet/reference/#Three_Way_Merge">
	Three Way Merge</a> for the Word Formatted Content.</li>
	<li>"Preview" -&gt; "Preview Source Artifact", "Preview Destination Artifact", 
	"Preview Merge Artifact" will show a preview in Word of the Artifact based 
	on the version selected.</li>
	<li>"Differences" -&gt; "Show Source Branch Differences", "Show Destination 
	Branch Differences", "Show Source/Destination Differences", "Show 
	Source/Merge Differences", "Show Destination/Merge Differences"&nbsp; will 
	generate differences based upon which option is selected.&nbsp; Allows the 
	user to see how different versions of the artifact differ.</li>
	<li>"Reveal Artifact in Explorer" - This option is only available when 
	either the Source or Destination Branch is set as the default branch.&nbsp; 
	When such is the case this will reveal the artifact in the Artifact Explorer 
	for the Branch that is the default branch.</li>
	<li>"Resource History" - This option is only available when either the 
	Source or Destination Branch is set as the default branch.&nbsp; When such 
	is the case this will reveal the resource history of the artifact on the 
	Branch that is the default branch.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Resolution Of Conflicts</h2>
<p>For <a href="http://127.0.0.1:4441/help/topic/org.eclipse.osee.framework.ui.skynet/reference/#Word_Formatted_Content">Word Formatted Content</a> conflicts see the section below.&nbsp; This 
section addresses all other conflicts.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Informational Conflicts</b><p>Informational conflicts are identified by 
	the
	<img src="ATS_files/issue.gif" width="16" border="0" height="16"> 
	icon in the conflict resolution column in the GUI.&nbsp; Informational 
	conflicts require no action by the user, and no actions are provided in the 
	GUI other than the ability to use the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:4441/help/topic/org.eclipse.osee.framework.ui.skynet/reference/#The_Right_Click_Menu">right 
	click menu</a> to examine the artifact using the tools provided there.&nbsp; 
	An informational conflict is generated when the Source branch deletes an 
	Artifact or an Attribute and that same Artifact or Attribute was modified on 
	the Destination Branch.&nbsp; This is to allow the user the opportunity to 
	review a change that was made on the Destination Branch that&nbsp; might 
	make them want to take some action in regards to their deletion.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;
	</p></li><li><b>Un-resolvable Conflicts</b><p>Un-resolvable Conflicts are identified 
	by the
	<img src="ATS_files/red_light.gif" width="16" border="0" height="16"> 
	icon in the conflict resolution column of the GUI. This conflicts require 
	the user to revert the Artifact or Attribute that caused the conflict on the 
	Source Branch.&nbsp; An Un-resolvable conflict is caused when the 
	Destination Branch deletes an Artifact or Attribute while the Source Branch 
	modifies that same Artifact, Attribute.&nbsp; The reason the user must 
	revert their changes is that committing in their changes would essentially 
	undo that deletion and bring that item back into existence. If the deletion 
	should not have happened the user needs to talk with the committer of the 
	deletion to resolve the issue.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;
	</p></li><li><b>Attribute Conflicts</b><p>Attribute Conflicts occur when both the 
	Destination and Source branch modify an attribute.&nbsp; This section will 
	cover all attributes except <a href="http://127.0.0.1:4441/help/topic/org.eclipse.osee.framework.ui.skynet/reference/#Word_Formatted_Content">Word Formatted 
	Content</a> Attributes.&nbsp; The resolution of these Attribute values 
	provide three options.&nbsp; Use the Source attribute value, use the 
	destination attribute value,&nbsp; use a modified value that is some 
	combination of the source and destination values. In order to use the Source 
	Value the user may left click on the
	<img src="ATS_files/green_s.gif" width="16" border="0" height="16"> 
	icon in the Source Value column.&nbsp; This will copy the
	<img src="ATS_files/green_s.gif" width="16" border="0" height="16"> 
	icon and the value displayed in the Source Value column into the Merged 
	Value Column.&nbsp; In order to use the Destination Value the user may left 
	click on the

<h2>Resolution Of Conflicts (<a name="Word_Formatted_Content">Word Formatted Content</a>)</h2>
<p>Resolution of conflicts is provided in two different ways.&nbsp; They can 
either copy and paste the changes into their Merge Artifact document or they can 
generate a Three Way Merge and accept the changes that show up in the generated 
document.&nbsp; Both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages and are 
best suited for different situations.&nbsp; They can also be combined where the 
situation warrants it, however the three way merge must always be done first if 
this is the case.</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<h3><b>Manual Merging</b></h3>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Usage</b><ul>
			<li>When one version of the artifact has many changes and the other 
			version has very few changes</li>
			<li>When both files have formatting changes</li>
			<li>When three way merging generates a complex document</li>
			<li>When both versions edit the same text in multiple places</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Manual Merging is the process of combining the Source Branch changes 
		and the destination branch changes manually by copying and pasting them 
		into the Merge Artifact document.&nbsp; The Merge Artifact is a separate 
		version of the artifact that will preserve the details of the Merge, and 
		will be reviewable in the Merge Manager after an artifact is committed.&nbsp; 
		IMPORTANT: If the user makes the changes to their Source Branch instead 
		of on the Merge Artifact the Merge Manager will incorrectly represent 
		the merge in future reviews.</p>
		The following procedure illustrates the functionality available 
		to facilitate a manual merge.
		<p>The user will first either launch the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:4441/help/topic/org.eclipse.osee.framework.ui.skynet/reference/#WFC%20Wizard">Merge Wizard</a> by left clicking 
		on the icon in the Merge Value column of the GUI or they may select the 
		functionality from the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:4441/help/topic/org.eclipse.osee.framework.ui.skynet/reference/#The_Right_Click_Menu">right click menu</a> for the conflict in question.&nbsp; 
		The first thing to do is to bring up a word document comparison of both 
		the Source Branch Version and the Destination Branch Version.&nbsp; 
		These documents will show all of the changes that have been made to 
		these two artifacts since the Source Branch was created.&nbsp; To launch 
		these difference's the user either select "Show Source Diff" and "Show 
		Destination Diff" from the wizard or "Differences"-&gt;"Show Source Branch 
		Differences" and "Differences"-&gt;"Show Destination Branch Differences" 
		from the right click menu.&nbsp; These will bring up the two 
		difference's in different Word instances with window labels to allow the 
		user to differentiate the files.&nbsp; The intention of bringing up 
		these difference's is twofold.&nbsp; Firstly, it allows the user to 
		identify the file that has the most changes.&nbsp; Secondly, it will 
		come in use later when the user copy's and paste's changes into the 
		Merge document.</p>
		<p>Upon identifying the branch that has the most changes the user should 
		then set the Merge Artifact to contain that branches value.&nbsp; This 
		is done by either selecting "Populate with Source Data" or "Populate 
		with Destination Data" from the Merge Wizard or left clicking on the 
	<img src="ATS_files/green_s.gif" width="16" border="0" height="16"> 
		icon or the
	<img src="ATS_files/blue_d.gif" width="16" border="0" height="16"> 
		icon in the Source and Destination Value columns in the Merge Manager 
		GUI.&nbsp; The user can then bring up the Merge Artifact for editing by 
		clicking on "Edit Merge Artifact" in the Merge Wizard or in the right 
		click menu.&nbsp; The Document that comes up contains the Merge Artifact 
		and any changes made to it will be reflected when the Source Branch is 
		committed.&nbsp; The user can than begin to copy the changes from the 
		diff report that showed the fewest changes (opposite of the one chosen 
		as the baseline).&nbsp; After all changes have been migrated into the 
		Merge Artifact document the user than saves the document, which will 
		preserve the Merge Artifact value.&nbsp; The user should be aware that 
		any changes they do not wish to preserve from either the Source or 
		Destination version of the Artifact need to be omitted on the Merge 
		Artifact. </p>
		<p>The user then right clicks on the
	<img src="ATS_files/chkbox_disabled.gif" width="16" border="0" height="16"> 
		in the Conflict Status Column so that the
	<img src="ATS_files/accept.gif" width="16" border="0" height="16"> 
		icon is displayed.&nbsp; The conflict is resolved and will allow the 
		Source Branch to be committed.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<h3 align="left"><b><a name="Three_Way_Merge">Three Way Merge</a></b></h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
		<p align="left"><b>Usage</b></p><ul>
			<li>
			<p align="left">When both versions have many changes or both versions have few 
			changes.
			</p></li><li>
			<p align="left">When only one file has formatting changes (Must be combined with 
			Manual Merging in this case)
			</p></li><li>
			<p align="left">When three way merging generates an understandable document
		</p></li></ul>
		<p align="left">Three Way Merging leverages Microsoft Words ability to merge 
		documents.&nbsp; At the beginning of any Word Formatted Content merge it 
		is recommended that user generate a Three Way Merge and check the 
		complexity of the document.&nbsp; In most cases Three Way Merging is a 
		quicker way to merge two documents, however in some cases the Three Way 
		Merge will generate a document that is difficult to use and understand.&nbsp; 
		This usually arises when the Source and Destination branches have edited 
		the same text or if one of the branches has touched a large percentage 
		of the file.&nbsp; As it runs fairly quickly it is always a good idea to 
		run it at the beginning of a Merge to check if it is useful.&nbsp; Three 
		Way Merging only allows the user to maintain format changes from one of 
		the documents.&nbsp; If format changes are made on both documents the 
		Three Way Merge will prompt the user as to which format changes they 
		would like to maintain, the user will then need to copy the format 
		changes from the other document into the Merge Artifact document 
		manually.</p>
		<p align="left">A Three Way Merge is generated by selecting Generate Three Way Merge 
		from either the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:4441/help/topic/org.eclipse.osee.framework.ui.skynet/reference/#WFC%20Wizard">Merge Wizard</a> or the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:4441/help/topic/org.eclipse.osee.framework.ui.skynet/reference/#The_Right_Click_Menu">right click menu</a>.&nbsp; IMPORTANT: 
		Generating a Three Way Merge will discard any changes made to the Merge 
		Artifact, therefore a prompt will make sure this is the intended 
		operation.&nbsp; If a user had started a Three Way Merge previously but 
		had not completed the Merge the user is also given the option of 
		continuing the previous Merge in the prompt (Selecting Edit Merge 
		Artifact will also have this effect). The following is an example of a 
		Three Way Merge in Word.</p><p align="center"><img src="ATS_files/Merge_3.gif" border="0">
		</p>
		<p align="center"><font size="4">A Three Way Merge</font></p><p>
		The changes made by the Source Branch and Destination Branch are shown 
		in different colors in the Word Document.&nbsp; In this particular case 
		the changes made in Red were done by the Source Branch and the changes 
		made in Blue were done on the Destination Branch.&nbsp; The color scheme 
		is not consistent and the user needs to verify which color equates to 
		which changes by hovering there mouse over one of the changes.&nbsp; A 
		popup will be shown which will identify the author.&nbsp; The following
		<a href="http://127.0.0.1:4441/help/topic/org.eclipse.osee.framework.ui.skynet/reference/http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/word/HA010983881033.aspx">
		Guide</a> will explain how to resolve the changes in the document. 
		IMPORTANT: All changes must be either accepted or rejected before the 
		conflict can be marked as resolved.&nbsp; After the user has resolved 
		all the changes it is a good idea to do generate a difference document 
		between the Source Artifact and the Merge Artifact, and the Destination 
		Artifact and the Merge Artifact by selecting "Show Source/Merge Diff" 
		and "Show Destination/Merge Diff" from the merge Wizard or 
		"Differences"-&gt;"Show Source/Merge Differences" and "Differences"-&gt;"Show 
		Destination/Merge Differences" from the 
		<a href="http://127.0.0.1:4441/help/topic/org.eclipse.osee.framework.ui.skynet/reference/#The_Right_Click_Menu">right click menu</a>.&nbsp; These 
		views will show the differences between the branch artifact and the 
		merge artifact.&nbsp; For the Source/Merge difference this will show 
		everything that is different between the source document and the Merge 
		document.&nbsp; In the case where the user accepts all changes from the 
		source and destination branches this diff will highlight all of the 
		changes that occurred on the destination branch. In the 
		Destination/Merge diff it will highlight all of the changes that 
		happened on the source branch.&nbsp; It is always possible to use Manual 
		Merging techniques in conjunction with Three Way Merging.</p>
		<p>The user then right clicks on the
	<img src="ATS_files/chkbox_disabled.gif" width="16" border="0" height="16"> 
		in the Conflict Status Column so that the
	<img src="ATS_files/accept.gif" width="16" border="0" height="16"> 
		icon is displayed.&nbsp; The conflict is resolved and will allow the 
		Source Branch to be committed.</p>

</ul>
<h2>Additional Features</h2>
<p>The Merge Wizard contains a "Clear the Merge Artifact" that is not available 
from the right click menu and only available for Word Formatted Content.&nbsp; This will empty out the Merge artifact and 
allow the user to start with an empty document for editing.&nbsp; It will also 
place a
	<img src="ATS_files/conflict.gif" width="16" border="0" height="16">icon 
in the merge value column for that conflict.</p>

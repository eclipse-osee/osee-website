The Open System Engineering Environment is an integrated, extensible tool environment for large engineering projects.

It provides a tightly integrated environment supporting lean principles across a 
product's full life-cycle in the context of an overall systems engineering approach.

OSEE's feature set includes configuration management, requirements management, testing, validation, and project management.

<h4>Extensible Data Model</h4>
<p>All project data is stored in OSEE's user-definable data model, which offers revision control, bidirectional traceability, project status reporting, and metrics.</p>

<div id="feature_2">
<h4>Full Lifecycle Support</h4>
<p>
The data integration and traceability features OSEE offers enable a coherent view of a project across its full life-cycle.
</p>

<div id="feature_3">
<h4>A Potent Framework</h4>
<p>
In addition to excelling as a stand-alone application, OSEE offers a full-featured API, enabling
developers to harness OSEE's powerful data management capabilities for their own applications. 
</p>
</div>

<div id="feature_4">
<h4>Version and Variant Management</h4>
<p>OSEE's advanced branch management capabilities, including change reports and automated merging,
make it possible to control many variants of a project with ease. Since OSEE retains a full revision
history of every resource in the system, engineers can make and review changes with greater confidence.</p>

<p>The Open System Engineering Environment (OSEE) project provides a tightly integrated environment supporting 
lean principles across a product's full life-cycle in the context of an overall systems engineering approach.  The 
system captures project data into a common user-defined data model providing bidirectional traceability, project 
health reporting, status, and metrics which seamlessly combine to form a coherent, accurate view of a project in 
real-time.  By building on top of this data model, OSEE has been architected to provide an all-in-one solution 
to configuration management, requirements management, testing, validation, and project management.  All of these 
work together to help an organization achieve lean objectives by reducing management activities, eliminating data 
duplication, reducing cycle-time through streamlined processes, and improving overall product quality through 
work flow standardization and early defect detection.
